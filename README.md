# 🌦️ Climate Connoisseur by Joseph Adetunji

**Climate Connoisseur** is a Python-based weather guessing game that tests players' meteorological knowledge.  
Players guess the current weather conditions for randomly selected locations around the world.

The game connects to the **WeatherAPI**, retrieving real-time temperature and conditions from over 100+ global locations.

## 🚀 Features
- Randomly selected cities from around the world  
- Real-time weather data using the WeatherAPI  
- Fun, educational, and easy to play

  ## How the Game Works -
1. This Python project is an interactive game where players test their meteorological instincts by guessing
    the live weather of a randomly selected location on Earth. The game fetches real-time weather data, including
    temperature and conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy, etc.), from an WeatherAPI and challenges the player to
   make an accurate prediction.
   
2.  After submitting their guess, players receive instant feedback on how close they were to the actual weather,
    making the game both educational and fun. It’s a creative way to explore global weather patterns while honing
    critical thinking and estimation skills.
